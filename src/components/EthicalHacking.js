      <h1>Introduction to Ethical Hacking</h1>
      <p>
        Ethical hacking involves identifying and mitigating security threats
        within systems and networks. Ethical hackers, also known as "white hat"
        hackers, work to find vulnerabilities to help organizations improve
        their security defenses.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Hackers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>White Hat Hackers:</strong> Authorized and ethical hackers who
          help protect systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Black Hat Hackers:</strong> Malicious hackers who exploit
          vulnerabilities for personal gain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gray Hat Hackers:</strong> Hackers who may breach systems
          without malicious intent but without permission.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ethical Hacking Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        Ethical hackers typically follow a structured process to identify
        vulnerabilities:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Reconnaissance:</strong> Gathering information about the
          target system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scanning:</strong> Identifying open ports, services, and
          potential vulnerabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gaining Access:</strong> Attempting to exploit weaknesses to
          access the system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintaining Access:</strong> Ensuring ongoing access for
          testing purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Covering Tracks:</strong> Clearing any evidence to maintain
          confidentiality.
        </li>
      </ol>
